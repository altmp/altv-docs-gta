# Stream Interiorproxies.meta Files
This Tutorial will show you, how to stream interiorproxies.meta on your Server. For this tutorial we will use [GTA IV Burgershot by Smallo](https://www.gta5-mods.com/maps/gtaiv-burgershot-interior-sp-and-fivem).

This Tutorial will answer the known "why are players invisible in my MLO" question.

## Suggested tools
* [OpenIV](https://openiv.com/)
* [Codewalker](https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/codewalker-gtav-interactive-3d-map)

## Adding the MLO to the Server
Download the MLO from the link above and add it as a resource to your Server. You can find the tutorial for streaming MLO's here: [MLOs]([Tutorial:Stream)
# Creating the Resource
1. Open ```dlc.rpf``` or any other ```*.rpf``` archive with one of the suggested tools from the downloaded resource and search for a file with the ending: ```milo_.ymap```
2. Copy the filename up to ```milo_``` to your clipboard.
3. Create a resourcefolder with the following structure below.
4. Create a ```interiorproxies.meta``` file inside the stream folder in your resourcefolder. You can see below at ```interiorproxies.meta``` how the file should look.

### **Folder Structure**
```
i-streamer/
|-> stream/
|    |-> interiorproxies.meta
|-> resource.toml
\-> stream.toml
```

### **resource.toml**
```
type = 'dlc',
main: 'stream.toml',

client-files = [ 'stream/*' ]
```

### **stream.toml**
```
files = [ 'stream/*' ]

[meta]
'stream/interiorproxies.meta' = 'INTERIOR_PROXY_ORDER_FILE'
```

### **interiorproxies.meta**
You can add every ```milo_``` as a ```<Item>``` into ```proxies```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<SInteriorOrderData>
    <startFrom value="2000"/>
    <proxies>
	<Item>vespucci_burgershot_milo_</Item>
    </proxies>
</SInteriorOrderData>
```
Add the ```i-streamer``` (folder name is your resource name) for the ```server.toml``` file.
