# Ambient Zones

Ambient Zones are sounds which are played in certain areas to improve the atmosphere. An example: the announcements and warning signals in Bolingbroke Penitentiary (Prison). There are a lot more than listed below, but these are the one which can be found in decompiled scripts. You can use CodeWalker to find more.
