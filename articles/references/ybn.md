# YBN

## Explaination

YBN is one of the formats used in GTA V. It declares static collisions with connection of a .yft.

There're two types of YBN's:

| Low Details | High Details |
| ----  | ------------ |
|   name.ybn    |   hi[at]name.ybn  |

Those collisions are formed by primitive shapes and low detailed shaping of the original form (See example)

## Example

YBN's are used for vehicles, buildings, general enviroment and weapons.
